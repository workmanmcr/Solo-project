    <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p> My name is <span class="name">MIKE.</span> My pronouns are he/him. I am 33 years old, I have been happily married for almost 3 years and I moved to Portland about a year ago 
        I've spent the majority of my life in a low-income family and was brought up to be able to make ends meet. 
        regardless of circumstances, through my trials in life, it has given me an amazing set of skills and an open mind
        to learn more. I always set myself up for success by learning not only the basics of a subject but why its important.
        to learn the subject in general. I continually push myself to learn new skills so I can apply them to my tool kit. My wife has referred to me as a Swiss army husband.
        I decied to get into tech as way to leave the manual labor behind and find something easier on my body and allows for a better qaulity of life.
        I have used these skills in a wide variety of jobs and situations that have helped me become an invaluable asset
        to the companies I've worked for. Over the years, these skills and jobs have led to many accomplishments.
